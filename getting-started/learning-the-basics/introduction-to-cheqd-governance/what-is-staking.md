# What is staking?

In order to bond tokens and add them to the active pool, users need to **delegate** their tokens to Node Operators. Tokens which are delegated to Node Operators are bonded and added to the active pool.&#x20;

This is known more simply, as **staking**.

**Stake** is the amount of tokens a **Node Operator** puts aside and dedicates to a networkâ€™s active pool, in order to contribute to governance and earn rewards. **Staking** is the verb used to describe this contribution. As cheqd is a Delegated Proof of Stake (PoS) Network, rewards can be earnt in direct correlation with the amount of stake a Node Operator contributes.

The goal for bonded tokens on the Network is **60%**. Below **60%** bonded tokens, the rate of inflation will increase, tending to **4%** **(inflation max)**. Above **60%** bonded tokens, the rate of inflation will decrease, tending towards **1% (inflation min)**.
