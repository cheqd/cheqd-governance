### **Summary**

This is an example of a Proposal Summary

_A short (\~150 word) description of the Proposal you want to make. Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the Proposal in plain English to have the best chance of gaining community interest and having it accepted._

_Optional_

### **Description**

_A longer <500 description of the changes you want to make, making direct references to where you want to make changes from, using links._

I want to change the cheqd Proposal Template because it misses a section on X. This amendment would make the process of making Proposals smoother for the entire community.

### **Consequences**

_This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the community and project in the future._

#### **Positive**

A new Governance template including X would be beneficial for the community and would make X easier to see.

#### **Negative**

No notable negative consequences

#### **Neutral**

Changing the template loses consistency over time
