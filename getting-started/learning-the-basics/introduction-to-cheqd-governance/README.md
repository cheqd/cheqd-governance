# üèÅ Introduction to cheqd Governance

cheqd's Governance model is based on a concept called Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).&#x20;

Simply put, this means that the amount of stake ($CHEQ) that a holder of $CHEQ, a **"User"**,  or a Node Operator holds, is directly proportionate to their voting power.&#x20;

In order to vote in the cheqd Network you need to have tokens which are in, what is known as, the **active pool**.&#x20;

### What is the active pool?

The active pool is all the tokens which can currently be used for Governance. Tokens which are in the active pool are also known as **bonded** tokens.

### Bonding and delegating

Bonded tokens are those present in the **active pool**. These are tokens that can be counted for the purpose of voting.

**Bonded** tokens = **staked** tokens by Node Operator + **delegated** tokens by user.

Once a user has delegated tokens to a Node Operator and has tokens added to the active pool, they are known as "**Participants".**

Users can delegate to multiple Node Operators at the same time to diversify their bonded token portfolio.

### Staking

In order to bond tokens and add them to the active pool, users need to **delegate** their tokens to Node Operators. Tokens which are delegated to Node Operators are bonded and added to the active pool.&#x20;

This is known more simply, as **staking**.

**Stake** is the amount of tokens a **Node Operator** puts aside and dedicates to a network‚Äôs active pool, in order to contribute to governance and earn rewards. **Staking** is the verb used to describe this contribution. As cheqd is a Delegated Proof of Stake (PoS) Network, rewards can be earnt in direct correlation with the amount of stake a Node Operator contributes.

The goal for bonded tokens on the Network is **60%**. Below **60%** bonded tokens, the rate of inflation will increase, tending to **4%** **(inflation max)**. Above **60%** bonded tokens, the rate of inflation will decrease, tending towards **1% (inflation min)**.
