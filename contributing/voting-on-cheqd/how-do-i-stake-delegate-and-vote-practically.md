# How do I stake, delegate and vote practically?

Governance on cheqd is carried out through our [Governance Dashboard](https://cheqd.omniflix.co). This can always be found at the link:

[https://cheqd.omniflix.co/](https://cheqd.omniflix.co)

This initial dashboard enables Users to:

1. Connect to their Keplr wallet
2. View their available token balance
3. View the amount of tokens staked
4. View available rewards
5. View unstaked tokens

This dashboard gives a holistic view of the tokens that Users hold at any point and where they are being used.

### How do I connect my Keplr wallet?

Make sure you are logged into Keplr on the same browser you are using the Governance Dashboard on.

If you click the button "**Connect" **in the top right hand corner you will get a pop up, like the image below:

Click **"Approve" **and this will attempt to connect your Keplr Wallet to the Governance Dashboard.&#x20;



### How do I delegate and stake my tokens?

On the dashboard you can either click **"Stake Tokens"** or click the tab in the right hand corner called **"Stake".**

You will be able to see a list of all the Validators, their voting power and their associated commission rate. You can read about what all these parameters mean below:

{% endcontent-ref %}

Press the button **"Delegate" **on your desired Validating Node Operator.&#x20;
