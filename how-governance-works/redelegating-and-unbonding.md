# Redelegating and Unbonding

If you want to move your tokens between from one Node Operator to another, you can do this instantaneously, without any unbonding period.&#x20;

If you want to completely withdraw and **unbond** your tokens from the [active pool](../getting-started/learning-the-basics/introduction-to-cheqd-governance/#what-is-the-active-pool), you need to be mindful that this process takes **2 weeks** for the tokens to become available for use again. This **unbonding period** is an example of a parameter which can be adjusted by the Governance Framework process.
