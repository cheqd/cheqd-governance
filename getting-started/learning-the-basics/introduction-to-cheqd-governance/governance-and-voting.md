# Governance and voting

### **Governance** and **voting**

Users with **bonded** tokens, **Participants**, are able to vote on **Governance Proposals**. The weight of a vote is directly tied to the amount of bonded tokens delegated to Node Operators.

This is where the Delegated Proof of Stake system comes into play.&#x20;

1. If the User does not want to vote on a Governance Proposal or misses it for any particular reason, the Node Operator will **inherit** the **delegated** tokens and can use them to vote with.
2. If you are particularly interested or passionate about a specific governance proposal, or do not agree with your bonded Node Operator, it is absolutely possible to vote unilaterally. However, you must still have **delegated** tokens, **bonded** with a Node Operator to do so.&#x20;

To do this, follow the instructions in the section[ Voting on cheqd](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/contributing/voting-on-cheqd).

In a nutshell:

**Node Operator voting power** = **initial stake** + **inherited delegated tokens** (if participants do not vote)

**Participant voting power** = **delegated tokens** (if participant chooses to vote)
