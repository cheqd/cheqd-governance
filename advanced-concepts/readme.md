# Overview

This section takes a deeper dive into some of the more technical, legal and architectural details of cheqd and its governance structure.

This section will continue to be iterated as the Network develops, but will start by explaining the following:

1. [Building on Cosmos:](building-on-cosmos.md)\
   Why cheqd decided to build on the Cosmos SDK, and what that means for the development of the Network.&#x20;
2.  [Strategy for Decentralisation:](strategy-for-decentralisation.md)

    How cheqd intends to decentralise control over time and increase network entropy
3. ****[**Trust over IP alignment:**](trust-over-ip-alignment.md)\
   How cheqd aligns itself with Trust over IP and intends to build a governance framework that can be implemented by any Layer 1 utility going forward.&#x20;

Through an understanding of these more advanced concepts, Users and Node Operators begin to gain a full understanding of cheqd and where all of the puzzle pieces fit together in its composition.
