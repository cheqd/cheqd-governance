# Strategy for Decentralisation

The principle concept of **decentralised governance** is that no single person, entity or organisation can control the direction of change in a public network. Instead, the direction of change is agreed by the democratic votes of an ever-growing, diverse collective.

On cheqd, voting and democratic change can be carried out through the use of our token and functional governance dashboard here:

cheqd intends to continually decentralise its network, and increase [Entropy](../getting-started/learning-the-basics/introduction-to-entropy.md). This has the following benefits:

* **It correlates with higher Network security and resiliency across countries;**
* **It means broader contributions to the Network from a multidisciplinary and diverse collective;**
* **It enables increased integration capabilities with other technologies to improve the ecosystem as a whole;**
* **It increases the democratisation of wealth and dilution of rewards across a larger scope of actors;**
* **It dilutes the control from a select group of people, to a genuinely decentralised and diverse collective.**

On the page [Introduction to Entropy](../getting-started/learning-the-basics/introduction-to-entropy.md), we laid out our framework for easily scoring visualising Entropy and decentralisation.

**Where are we now?**

Last updated 25/01/2022

* 50 Network Node Operators
* 10+ countries validating
* 7 = Minimum number of Node Operators to reach threshold (Nakamoto Coefficient)&#x20;
* 2 Exchanges
* 1 Proposal made
* 25+ merged pull requests

#### Where we want to get to

We are aiming for continually increasing decentralisation, which involves:

1. **Making it easy for Node Operators to onboard in an Open Source way;**
2. **Having clear and transparent documentation, in multiple languages;**
3. **Having simple governance processes to evolve the Network baked into the protocol;**
4. **Incentivising a healthy community, with places to discuss positive and constructive ideas.**
5. **Enabling all parties to be remunerated for their active contribution and participation.**

Soon we will be launching a governance dashboard to more accurately display our Entropy score and decentralisation in real time.&#x20;
