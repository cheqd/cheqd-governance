# Legal Disclaimer

## Preface

{% hint style="info" %}
No regulatory authority in Singapore, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore, has reviewed or approved the CHEQ Tokens or any of the Information constituting cheqd Documentation. 
{% endhint %}

This Disclaimer **\(“Disclaimer”\)** serves as a point of information for Entities participating in the cheqd Network **\(the “Network”\)** to understand the potential liability and accountability that they might be subject to in the course of their use of the cheqd Network.

When it comes to **Decentralised Protocol Ecosystems** or **Decentralised Autonomous Organisations \(DAOs\)**, accountability is becoming an increasingly important issue. This is because:

1. The Network is spread across multiple jurisdictions;
2. There are multiple Entities involved in decision making;
3. There is no traditional, corporate facing Entity;
4. Accountability changes over time as the Network develops.

As explained in [Introduction to Governance](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/getting-started/introduction-to-governance), the Network is governed largely by [Architecture](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/getting-started/introduction-to-governance#4-architecture) and relies far less on [Laws and Guidelines](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/getting-started/introduction-to-governance#1-law-and-guidelines) ****than any traditional, centralised ecosystem. 

Owing to these factors, when decentralised networks overlap with traditional business models, such as in banking and finance, there is a legal grey area. 

This Disclaimer explains where the grey areas lie, and how we have structured accountability in the Network through the [Principle of Increasing Entropy](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/principles#3-the-principle-of-increasing-entropy). It will also take into account legislation which has attempted to give greater legal clarity to DAOs, such as the [Wyoming Limited Liability Company Act 2021](https://www.wyoleg.gov/2021/Introduced/SF0038.pdf).   


## Definitions

In this Disclaimer, the words and phrases below have the following respective meanings laid out in the [Glossary of Terms](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/terminology-and-glossary/glossary).  


## Corporate Face

cheqd is a **Company Limited by Guarantee \(CLG\)**, incorporated in **Singapore**. This type of Entity is more commonly labelled as a **Foundation**.  

The corporate responsibility for the cheqd Network will **initially** sit with this Singaporean CLG, as this will be the Entity responsible for issuing tokens to the Network and setting the genesis parameters.

The Singapore CLG will bear corporate responsibility for cheqd Network during the period of **Low Entropy** and will have a Fiduciary duty to the Network, meaning it **SHOULD** act in good faith, with a duty of care and loyalty to the best-interests of the Network. 

As **Entropy increases** and the Network becomes more decentralised, cheqd CLG will become less-and-less able to act as the Corporate Face of the Network. This is because control will shift from the centralised Entity, to being diluted across the cheqd Network. The cheqd Network Governance model means that decision making will increasingly be spread throughout the Network and is intended to be decentralised.  

At the point of **Sufficient Decentralisation** and **High Entropy** the Corporate Face of the Network will be spread between the Node Operators of the Network and token holders, who will jointly make decisions affecting the course of the Network.

At this point, the Network as a **DAO** will be a **Member Managed Decentralised Autonomous Organisation \(DAO\)**. The cheqd CLG will have no locus of direct control over the Network. The Corporate Face of the Network will be essentially indeterminable at this stage, given the legal grey area that DAOs currently sit in. This is akin to how the SEC in the United States of America have qualified Networks such as **Ethereum**, as being **Sufficiently Decentralised**. 

No member of the cheqd DAO shall have any fiduciary duty to the organization or any member except that the members shall be subject to the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

For more information on the points at which we suggest these accountability changes occur, refer to our [documentation on Entropy](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/getting-started/introduction-to-entropy).  


### Notice of Restrictions on Duties and Transfers

The rights of members in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(DAO\) may differ materially from the rights of members in other limited liability companies. Members should familiarise themselves with this Documentation and [wider documentation regarding the legal classification of DAOs](https://www.lextechinstitute.ch/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DAO-Model-Law.pdf) before participating in the cheqd Network.  


## CHEQ token

{% hint style="info" %}
No regulatory authority in Singapore, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore, has reviewed or approved the CHEQ Tokens or any of the Information constituting cheqd Documentation. 
{% endhint %}

The Documentation included in this Governance Framework **DOES NOT** constitute either an offer or solicitation of securities or any other regulated product and is neither a promotion, invitation nor solicitation for investment purposes. The CHEQ Tokens **DO NOT** represent equity, shares, units, royalties or rights to capital, profit, returns or income in the cheqd Network, cheqd Foundation or any other company or intellectual property associated with the cheqd ecosystem, or any other public or private enterprise, corporation, foundation or other entity in any jurisdiction. 

The CHEQ Tokens **ARE** **NOT** intended to represent a security or similar legal interest.

We are of the opinion that the CHEQ Tokens **ARE NOT**  “capital markets products” as contemplated under [Part I of the The Securities and Futures Act \(SFA\)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/SFA2001#P1I-), solely by virtue of the Token Functions.
