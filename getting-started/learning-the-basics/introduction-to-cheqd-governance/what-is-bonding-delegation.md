# What is bonding / delegation?

Bonded tokens are those present in the [**active pool**](what-is-the-active-pool.md). These are tokens that can be counted for the purpose of voting.

**Bonded** tokens = **staked** tokens by Node Operator + **delegated** tokens by user.

Once a user has delegated tokens to a Node Operator and has tokens added to the active pool, they are known as "**Participants".**

Users can delegate to multiple Node Operators at the same time to diversify their bonded token portfolio.
