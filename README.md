# cheqd-governance

## **Before you cheq in...**

Governance Frameworks are generally perceived as largely inaccessible documents, for various reasons:

1. People do not understand what governance is, or why it is important;
2. The documentation is generally convoluted and difficult to find;
3. They are too formal and written in abrasive, legal language;
4. They do not educate the reader about the concepts they are governing.

At cheqd, we want our Governance Framework to be something that is easy to read, understand and use in practice. We want this document to be clearly understood by a diverse and multidisciplinary audience and collective, spanning across the world.

We are committed to writing our documentation in simple language, using easy examples to explain difficult concepts, and designing a Governance Framework which is open and easy to change.

This is the most important part of any governance framework...

**We believe that core to our governance framework, above all, is first, common understanding and common acknowledgement of how a system is run, and secondly, clear, accessible and democratic ways to influence decisions and the direction of change. This can only be achieved through clear communication, transparency and inclusivity**
