# ‚úç How to Contribute

## How do I make changes on the Network?

Every User is encouraged to contribute to the cheqd Network. To make this easy, it is important to explain HOW a User can contribute, and what the best practices are for making changes.

For this reason, it is important to distinguish when a change can be made entirely off-ledger, and when a change is needed to be voted on, and made on-ledger. To do this we must differentiate between **minor changes** which are able to take place **entirely off-ledger** and **major network changes** which need to be **formalised on-ledger.**

### **Minor Network changes**

These are changes that are insignificant, and do not affect the way the Network runs overall. Minor Network changes include, but are not limited to:

* Textual edits to the Governance Framework or written general documentation;
* Sensible additions to general documentation to improve clarity;
* Minor code changes;
* Finding, reporting and suggesting fixes to bugs;
* Translating the cheqd documentation into various languages.

### Major Network changes

These are changes that have a materially significant effect on the Network. Such changes SHOULD be made via a Proposal, following the steps in the decision tree diagram below.

Major Network changes include, but are not limited to:

* Materially significant Architecture Decisions (**ADs**), such as:
  * An additional feature to cheqd;
  * Removal of a feature of cheqd;
* Parameter changes for the Network;
* Community pool decisions;
* Materially significant changes to a cheqd Principle;
* Significant connections to other infrastructure.

## cheqd's Principles

Whenever a **major network change** takes place on the Network, reference MUST be made to [cheqd's Foundational Principles](../principles/foundational-principles.md). The Principles should act as a checks and balance against **major network changes.**

This means, that **major network changes** should never oppose a Principle, unless it is [acting to update or change a Principle](../principles/foundational-principles.md#1.-the-principle-principle).

## Community

You do not have to own any CHEQ to participate in our community discussion. You are free to learn about cheqd and participate in our community discussions across multiple platforms and forums.

We want learning about cheqd and participating in the community to be easy and accessible. For this reason, we have decided to make sure our [Governance](https://gov.cheqd.io), [Learning](https://learn.cheqd.io/) and [Product](https://product.cheqd.io/) wikis and our [source code](https://github.com/cheqd) are natively interconnected.

**What does this mean?**

If you are a technical person and want to make changes directly to our source code, on a text-based or code-based change, you can do this directly on our [GitHub](https://github.com/cheqd).

If you are non-technical and want to make edits in a more visual way, you can do this here on GitBook by [becoming an editor](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MiQSPMufVJdYEwQHd2c/s/vFD59OFvvoxQacSSpE1X/).

Quick note: we have a separate GitBook for:

1. [Learning and education](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MiQSPMufVJdYEwQHd2c/s/5j0qcgqqFLaVpv4dlkgf/);
2. [Technical documentation](https://docs.cheqd.io/node/);
3. [cheqd Product](https://product.cheqd.io/); and
4. [Governance Framework](https://gov.cheqd.io/).

Which both link to their respective GitHub repositories.
