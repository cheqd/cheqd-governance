# What is bonding / delegation?

Bonded tokens are those present in the [active pool](what-is-the-active-pool.md). These are tokens that can be counted for the purpose of voting.

Users, i.e. persons who hold $CHEQ, are able to delegate tokens to [Node Operators](validators-and-node-operators.md) in order to have those tokens bonded and added to the [active pool](what-is-the-active-pool.md). &#x20;

Once a user has delegated tokens to a Node Operator and has tokens added to the [active pool](what-is-the-active-pool.md), they are known as "**Participants".**

Users can delegate to multiple [Node Operators](validators-and-node-operators.md) at the same time to diversify their bonded token portfolio.

There are multiple reasons why Users may want to delegate their tokens:

[why-should-i-delegate-and-stake-my-tokens.md](why-should-i-delegate-and-stake-my-tokens.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The hard-coded goal for bonded tokens on the cheqd Network is **60%**.&#x20;

Below **60%** bonded tokens, the rate of inflation on the cheqd Network will increase, tending to **4%** **(inflation max)**. Above **60%** bonded tokens, the rate of inflation will decrease, tending towards **1% (inflation min)**.
