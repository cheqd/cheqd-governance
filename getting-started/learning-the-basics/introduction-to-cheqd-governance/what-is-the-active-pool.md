## What is the active pool?

The active pool is all the tokens which can currently be used for voting and Governance processes.

Tokens which are in the active pool are also known as [**bonded**](what-is-bonding-delegation.md) tokens.

Tokens in the active pool cannot be instantly sold because they are being actively used for governance purposes.
