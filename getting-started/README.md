# Getting started with Governance

## **Where to start**

If you are not familiar with Governance, and especially decentralised governance, we suggest that you should begin with our introductory documents:

1. [Introduction to Governance](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/getting-started/introduction-to-governance)  ****This document explains how we define governance, and why it is crucial in the management of a decentralised Network. 
2. [Introduction to cheqd](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/getting-started/introduction-to-cheqd)  This document explains what cheqd is trying to achieve, and what the intended goal of the Network is. 
3. [Introduction to Entropy](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/getting-started/introduction-to-entropy)  This document introduces the concept of Entropy in decentralised governance. Entropy is pivotal to understanding how liability and accountability changes as the Network expands. 

### Still a bit confused?

We’ve got some super simple videos on our Youtube channel explaining SSI and the objectives of cheqd.

1. [What is Self-Sovereign Identity?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9f36Sh4CFM)
2. [How decentralised identity is used in real life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX38IhG7OpA)
3. [Why SSI is a better way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObhY0SGsFY)
4. [How cheqd’s model works and why we chose Cosmos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAxNUfJ75LI)

And we also have a glossary to help you understand all this technical mumbo jumbo!
