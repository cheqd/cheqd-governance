# üèÅ Introduction to cheqd Governance

cheqd's Governance model is based on a concept called Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).&#x20;

Simply put, this means that the amount of stake ($CHEQ) that a holder of $CHEQ, a **"User"**,  or a Node Operator holds, is directly proportionate to their voting power.&#x20;

In order to vote in the cheqd Network you need to have tokens which are in, what is known as, the **active pool**.&#x20;

### What is the active pool?

The active pool is all the tokens which can currently be used for Governance. Tokens which are in the active pool are also known as **bonded** tokens.

### Bonding and delegating

Bonded tokens are those present in the **active pool**. These are tokens that can be counted for the purpose of voting.

**Bonded** tokens = **staked** tokens by Node Operator + **delegated** tokens by user.

Once a user has delegated tokens to a Node Operator and has tokens added to the active pool, they are known as "**Participants".**

Users can delegate to multiple Node Operators at the same time to diversify their bonded token portfolio.

### Staking

In order to bond tokens and add them to the active pool, users need to **delegate** their tokens to Node Operators. Tokens which are delegated to Node Operators are bonded and added to the active pool.&#x20;

This is known more simply, as **staking**.

### **Governance** and **voting**

Users with **bonded** tokens, **Participants**, are able to vote on **Governance Proposals**. The weight of a vote is directly tied to the amount of bonded tokens delegated to Node Operators.

This is where the Delegated Proof of Stake system comes into play.&#x20;

1. If the User does not want to vote on a Governance Proposal or misses it for any particular reason, the Node Operator will **inherit** the **delegated** tokens and can use them to vote with.
2. If you are particularly interested or passionate about a specific governance proposal, or do not agree with your bonded Node Operator, it is absolutely possible to vote unilaterally. However, you must still have **delegated** tokens, **bonded** with a Node Operator to do so.&#x20;

To do this, follow the instructions in the section[ Voting on cheqd](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/contributing/voting-on-cheqd).

In a nutshell:

**Node Operator voting power** = **initial stake** + **inherited delegated tokens** (if participants do not vote)

**Participant voting power** = **delegated tokens** (if participant chooses to vote)
