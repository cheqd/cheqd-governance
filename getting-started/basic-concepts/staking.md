# What is staking?

As previously mentioned, in order to [bond](delegation-and-bonding.md) tokens and add them to the [active pool](active-pool.md), users need to [**delegate**](delegation-and-bonding.md) their tokens to [Node Operators](validators.md).

This is known, more simply, as **staking**.

**Stake** is the amount of tokens a [Node Operator](validators.md) puts aside and dedicates to a networkâ€™s [active pool](active-pool.md), in order to contribute to governance and earn rewards.

It is called staking because it is not totally risk free. There is a possibility that if the Node Operator exhibits bad behaviour, some of the stake may be slashed.
