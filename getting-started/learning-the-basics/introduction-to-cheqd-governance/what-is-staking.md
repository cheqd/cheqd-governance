# What is staking?

As previously mentioned, in order to [bond](what-is-bonding-delegation.md) tokens and add them to the [active pool](what-is-the-active-pool.md), users need to [**delegate**](what-is-bonding-delegation.md) **** their tokens to [Node Operators](../../../how-governance-works/validators-and-node-operators.md).

This is known, more simply, as **staking**.

**Stake** is the amount of tokens a **Node Operator** puts aside and dedicates to a networkâ€™s [active pool](what-is-the-active-pool.md), in order to contribute to governance and earn rewards.&#x20;
